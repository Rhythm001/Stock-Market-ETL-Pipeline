# Stock Market ETL Pipeline

An end-to-end automated **ETL pipeline** that extracts stock market data, processes and validates it, stores it in PostgreSQL, and orchestrates the workflow using **Apache Airflow** and **Docker Compose**.

This project demonstrates practical data engineering concepts including workflow orchestration, data validation, SQL transformations, modular pipeline design, and containerized deployment.

## Workflow

### 1. Extract
Fetch historical stock market data from source APIs.

### 2. Load
Store raw stock data in PostgreSQL.

### 3. Transform
Apply SQL transformations to create enriched analytical datasets.

### 4. Validate
Run automated quality checks:

- Null value detection
- Invalid price validation
- Ticker completeness checks

### 5. Report
Generate summary outputs.

### 6. Orchestrate
Schedule and monitor execution through Apache Airflow.

## Setup Instructions

### Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rhythm001/Stock-Market-ETL-Pipeline.git
cd Stock-Market-ETL-Pipeline
```

---

### Configure Environment

Create a `.env` file:

```env
DB_URL=postgresql://username:password@host:5432/database
```

---

### Run the Pipeline

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

---

### Access Airflow UI

```text
http://localhost:8080
```

Trigger DAG:

```text
stock_market_etl
```

---

## Validation Results

Successful execution confirms:

- Data extraction completed
- Raw data successfully loaded
- Transformations executed
- Quality checks passed
- Reports generated
- DAG completed successfully

---

## Sample Output

**Database Validation**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM stock_prices_enriched;
-- 599
```

---

## Key Learnings
